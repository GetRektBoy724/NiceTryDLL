# NiceTryDLL
NiceTryDLL is a PoC of detecting direct syscall methods that reads NTDLL from disk. By hooking NtReadFile, it can detects both file read and file copy. For identifying the DLL, it call `NtQueryInformationFile` for getting the FileNameInformation of the file handle, and then check if the file path ends with `ntdll.dll` (or any DLL that is being blacklisted on the program, you can add more DLL to the blacklist by modifying the `BlacklistedDLLs` public variable). Since file read and file copy uses NtReadFile, The only way attacker can evades this is to rename the system's NTDLL to something else or hook `NtQueryInformationFile` to spoof the filename. Again, this is just a PoC, you can add more checks to validate if the DLL is NTDLL if you want to.
